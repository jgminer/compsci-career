## Background and Intro

Computer science is a very broad field, and that is an understatement. Everything I say on this page are my opinions and mine alone.

## Are you interested in computers and/or technology?
If you're interested in computers or technology, there tend to be many, many opportunities for learning and employment.

Computer Science is just one area of study within technology. Some related and adjacent fields include:

* Information Technology (IT)
    * Broad field that applies computer science to real world problems
* Computer Engineering
    * More on the hardware side - Central Processing Units (CPUs) design, etc.
* Network Engineering
    * Think routers, switches, etc - how the internet is able to function
* Data Science
* Information Science
* Artificial Intelligence (AI)
* Security Engineering/Cybersecurity
* And many, many more!

## What is DevOps?
DevOps is an overloaded term and is technically not a role but a culture where you are trying to bridge the historical gap between IT operations and software development. For at least part of the history of computer software running businesses, there has been friction between the folks that run the software vs the ones who write it. 

DevOps attempts to blur the lines between the roles and encourage software developers to dabble in operations and vice versa. At the end of the day, it’s another role within the realm of IT, Computer Science, and Software Engineering.

## Do you recommend DevOps as a career?

I actually fell into DevOps by accident. In college, I had internships that were more IT-oriented, specifically around network engineering. However, around my Junior year I realized I wanted to do something more focused on software development (I was studying computer science), so I found DevOps as a role that combines my experience (IT, from internships), with my education (Computer Science). I am, of course, biased, but I do recommend DevOps or any career path related to technology frankly, especially if you are at all interested in technology.

## What do you do on a typical day?
One of the beauties of a hybrid role like DevOps is that every day is different! Sometimes I get to write Python scripts that help glue together different components of our products or assist with operations. Other days I’m planning our sprint which is like planning the work we will do over the next two weeks. On still other days I might be troubleshooting production (live environment that people are using) outages and trying to prevent them from happening again.

## What is Ping Identity?
Ping Identity is a software company based here in Denver specializing in security software centered around identity. Specifically, we have software products that help large companies manage their applications for single-sign-on (think signing into Google and using that to sign into other sites). We protect login pages, protect systems within companies and external to companies, and much more. Visit our site for more info: https://www.pingidentity.com/
